## ðŸ§  Project Overview: What We Built

**Smart Meeting Summarizer** is an end-to-end AI-powered tool that transforms raw meeting recordings into structured insights â€” in just a few clicks.

### ðŸŽ¯ What It Does

1. **Transcribes meeting audio/video** using [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper)
2. **Summarizes the conversation** using GPT-4 with a custom prompt
3. **Extracts action items** clearly and concisely
4. Provides a **simple Streamlit interface** for non-technical users
5. Keeps API keys secure via `.env` loading

### ðŸ§± How It Works (Architecture)

- **Frontend/UI**: Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
  - Upload an `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, or `.mp4` file
  - Displays transcript, summary, and action items

- **Transcription**: Powered by OpenAI's Whisper model (`tiny`/`base`)
  - Converts speech to text locally

- **Summarization + Actions**:
  - Uses GPT-4 via OpenAI API
  - Custom system prompt guides GPT to:
    - Provide a structured meeting summary
    - Output a clean bullet-point list of action items

- **Environment Management**:
  - Project uses a virtual environment (`venv`)
  - API key is securely loaded from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`

### ðŸ’¡ Why Itâ€™s Cool

- âš¡ **Instant productivity** boost: no more manual note-taking
- ðŸ“Ž AI-native solution that integrates two powerful models
- ðŸ§ª Easy to demo & extend: plug in calendar APIs, topic tagging, etc.
- ðŸ§  Great showcase of applied NLP, multimodal AI, and Python engineering
